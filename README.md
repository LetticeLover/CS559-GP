# CS559-GP
This is my final project for UW Madison's CS559 course.

## Description
This is a Tower Defense game. This means that there is a path from a start point to an end point, and that enemies periodically spawn at the start and start moving along the path to the end. The player wants to prevent the enemies from reaching the end and has the ability to place towers that shoot damaging projectiles to stop the enemies. A wave spawns a certain number of enemies, and enemies slowly grow stronger with each wave. The player's goal is to survive as long as possible and therefore get the highest score possible.

There are three types of towers in the game:
* Basic: This tower has a short range and low damage but shoots very fast. Good for taking out fast but weak creatures.
* Ranger: This tower has a long range and high damage but shoots slowly. Good for dealing with slow and tanky enemies.
* Farm: This tower does not shoot enemies, but generates you currency over time. Placing a few of these after surviving the first couple rounds will surely guarantee your survival.

The controls are simple: you can select a type of tower at the bottom of the screen and place it in the world by clicking at the location you want it to be. Selecting a tower and then hovering over the ground will show a circle displaying the range of the selected tower. Additionally, you can click a selected tower button to deselect the tower and thus click about the screen to your content without accidentally placing a tower.

## Settings:
You can choose the amount of lives you start with, the amount of currency you start with, and the difficulty of the game before starting a game. The harder the difficulty the greater the health, speed, and score value of enemies.

## Camera Controls:
You can pan about the world with a left click and drag. You can rotate the world with a right click and drag. You can zoom in and out by scrolling.

## Miscellaneous Buttons:
There is a mode button in the top right that changes the graphics mode of the game. There is also a pause button which pauses the game entirely. Finally, there is a menu button which will quit your game and return you to the menu.
When you finish a wave, a button will pop up in the top part of your screen that you can click to begin the next wave.
When you inevitably game over, you can choose to either restart right away with the same settings or go back to the menu to change some settings.
